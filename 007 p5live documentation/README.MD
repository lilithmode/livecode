# today i worked with my good friends maria and zoe and we made a lot of fun visuals using p5.live and the hydra library that was inside of it !!

### a lot of the inital findings were essentially starting with a voronoi (the classic) and running everything through so many different effects until we found something that we liked. 

### on top of that, zoe ü•π and maria ü•∫ were very helpful and super cooperative in the visual process. great back and forth was had when it came to debugging a lot of the things that would act up. ESPECIALLY THIS ONE. 

```.add(solid(.2,0,.3)).mask(shape([20,5]).scale([1,2,3]).repeat(5,5)
.rotate(1.5)).scrollX([0.1,-0.0625,0.005,0.00001],0)```

### THIS EVIL LINE kept breaking on us until we had to realize that we had forgotten some of our syntax. OOPSIES.

### everything else kind of ran through a bus of some sort, but we ended up commenting out a lot of the effects because it just looked like vomit at the end of the day. check it. here's the whole patch.

### shoutout foodman ! he was the backing track to a lot of our work ü¶ç and using the bpm function ended up being so clutch because it really fit the music! 

### i learned today that i didn't really like the gradient option as much as i thought i would because the zero'd in settings make it look red and green. YUCKY. 

#### today's mvps were .modulate(noise) and .mask(shape) -- if no one has me i know those two have me !
