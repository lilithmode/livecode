# two things that were new to me :D

#### two things that were new to me while reading this article was the topic of defamiliarization. I think there is something interesting with making programming a method of "unthinking" compared to the more logical mindsets that i'm usually used to. being able to make software "strange" completely changes the script for me (no pun intended) and i'm willing to see how much more that can take me. another thing that surprised me is definitely the more exhibitionist nature of live coding. as someone who participates in controllerism, i'm so used to hiding behind the veil of "technique" and "the hidden depths" of doing things that the crowd can't process. being able to participate in this sort of exhibitionism and having the curtain be unveiled live is something that's fairly new to me, but i'm all about opening the floodgates so people can learn and watch.

#### two things that were definitely familiar to me is the integration of audio software in a bunch of media. being able to finally dive a little bit into each territory might be benficial to me because i intend to dip my toes in some of these industries for fun. Another thing that I already knew about is the notion of setting up a performance. i have done this many times especially with all kinds of different sets regarding hardware and software alike, so having some handrails on a performance isn't anything too new to me.
