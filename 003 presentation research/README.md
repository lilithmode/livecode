## presentation proposal

#### i want to do a presentation on the dance or don't series in boston, that has a particular focus on certain live coding in terms of visuals and sometimes music. 

#### the reason why i want to showcase this (besides me having played one of their events in the past) is because i feel that boston's live coding scene is honestly slept on, especially with the amount of people that show up there such as PEPPIN, Switch_Angel, and sysfem.err as a couple examples. 

#### i could talk about the whole event in general but the biggest thing that i want to point out is the symbiosis between the live coders and the performers, and how the live coder can play such an integral role in the performer's seat and the visuals seat.
